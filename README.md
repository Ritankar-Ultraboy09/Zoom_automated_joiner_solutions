# Zoom_automated_joiner_solutions
Just another Easy Program, Which will help you to launch zoom and join meetings automatically. 

# A close observation:-
Now , unlike MS Teams, Zoom app has a feature where you can not start a meeting , untill is started by THE HOST or THE ORGANIZER. Now this thing has a drawback as well as an advantage:-

### * Advantage
 1. You need not have to worry about joning too early or too late, The whole beginning and the and ending process of the meeting stays in the hands of the Host, so there is no     OVERUSAGE of Internet in Both the cases.
 
### * Drawback
 1. As said, you have no powers here of starting the meeting early , which may piss you off, if you want to talk to your colleagues and discuss on certain things or plan something before the meeting starts.

# Why should you download this thing? 
Now downloading this .py file will not give access to start the meeting before the host, That will not happen for sure. 
But, If you are busy somewhere but your attendance is counted in that meeting so you can use this, just open 2-3 tabs of this program and put all the required informations about the meeting and run it, you will automatically join and leave the meetings, without having any tension of actually attending it.

# How to use:-
### Just download the file and run if you have Python 3.5 or above in you system. That's it!
